				<p><h3>Dukh Niwaran Gurdwara,Patiala</h3>

                    One kilometre northwest of the bus stand (turn left out of the bus stand, walk past the train station and it's eventually on your right) stands this gurdwara, credited with healing powers thanks to a miraculous cure carried out by Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur in 1672. <b>It is said that visitors are relieved of their earthly sufferings and sorrows.</b></p>

The 3 sq km (1.9 sq mi) lake accommodates a wide range of non-polluting water sports, including rowing and kayaking. An extensive jogging path encircles the lake, offering a great opportunity for those looking to keep fit, while a number of stalls sell street food and snacks. Bird-watchers should look out for migratory exotic birds, such as Siberian ducks or storks.</p>

				<p><h3>Sunset Point, Kasauli</h3>
                    <h4>Punjab(India)</h4>This one is a beautiful place to witness the serene sunset. It’s nearby the Lover’s Lane and is a sight to behold. With the color changing at sundown with a light shade of yellow, to tangerine and with a hint of pink and purple, the colors paint the most exquisite of pictures at the horizon. The town is shrouded in a pall of darkness post sunset. It is a great spot to spend your evenings. It also gives way to the trail to trek.</p>
